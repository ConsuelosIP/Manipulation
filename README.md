This repository contains the supporting materials for the manuscript: Phillips, J. &amp; Shaw, A. (under review). Manipulating morality: Third-party intentions alter moral judgments by changing causal reasoning. 

The analysis code (written in R) is in "manipulationAnalyses.R". This code reads in the data for the different experiments in the folders labeled "StudyX". Along with the data (in .csv and .sav format) these folders contain the .qsf file with the original stimuli used to conduct the study through Qualtrics and the publication graph (the code for these is also in the analysis file).
