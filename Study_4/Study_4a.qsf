While it wasn't part of their plan, the government accidentally destroyed farm machinery and set fire to several food stores by mistake. As a result, there was a serious lack of food the country. Soon the people living in the city couldn't get enough food to feed themselves.

Right at that time, a group of industrial workers heard on the government news channel that a neighboring village had a surplus of food. After hearing the news, the group of industrial workers raided the small village on the country's border, stealing food from the farmers and killing innocent people.

Douglas goes to a large orange farm and begins to talk to the harvesters. He gathers the harvesters together and tells them that they are being treated poorly compared to other harvesters and that they may soon be replaced by immigrants who will work for less money. As a result, he says, they could even lose their homes and their families are at risk of being on the streets. He tells them they have to demand better conditions and job security. The harvesters hear his speech and believe they will soon lose their jobs. As a result, a riot breaks out and leads to a truck being overturned which explodes and burns a portion of the orange farm.
